/**
 * https://www.interviewcake.com/question/java/find-duplicate-optimize-for-space?course=fc1&section=sorting-searching-logarithms
 *
 * We have an array of integers, where:
 *
 * The integers are in the range 1..n1..n
 * The array has a length of n+1n+1
 * It follows that our array has at least one integer which appears at least twice. But it may have several duplicates,
 * and each duplicate may appear more than twice.
 *
 * Write a method which finds an integer that appears more than once in our array. (If there are multiple duplicates,
 * you only need to find one of them.)
 *
 * We're going to run this method on our new, super-hip MacBook Pro With Retina Displayâ„¢. Thing is, the damn thing came
 * with the RAM soldered right to the motherboard, so we can't upgrade our RAM. So we need to optimize for space!
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * O(1) space and O(nlgn) time.
 *
 * Tricky as this solution is, we can actually do even better, getting our runtime down to O(n)
 * while keeping our space cost at O(1). The solution is NUTS; it's probably outside the scope of
 * what most interviewers would expect. But for the curious...here it is!
